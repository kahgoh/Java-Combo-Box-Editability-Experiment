Java Combo Box Selection and Editability and Enabled State Experiment
=====================================================================

I wrote this to experiment with the JComboBox to see how the change in the editable and disabled state can effect the selected item, especially when the user has entered some text into the combo box.

Running the experiment will bring up a window with some controls. Clicking on "by text field" will insert the text directly into the combo box's text field. Selecting "by selection" will try to set the selection on the combo box. Pressing "Print Selected" will print (in system output) what the combo box thinks is currently selected.

Requires Java 7 and MigLayout.
